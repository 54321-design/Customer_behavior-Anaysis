# Customer_Behavior Analysis
🚀 End-to-End Data Analysis Project | Python • SQL • Power BI

#📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analysis workflow starting from raw dataset loading to interactive dashboard creation and reporting

The objective of this project is to:

- Perform RDA (Research & Data Analysis)

- Clean and preprocess raw data

- Execute SQL queries across multiple database systems

- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

- Generate a professional report and presentation

This project showcases skills in Python, SQL, Data Cleaning, Visualization, and Business Reporting.

# 📂 Dataset

- The dataset contains structured data related to business/operational metrics.

- It includes multiple attributes such as categorical, numerical, and date-based columns.

- The dataset was cleaned, validated, and transformed before analysis.

# 🔎 Project Steps
## 1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

- Imported dataset using Pandas

- Checked structure, data types, and summary statistics

## 2️⃣ RDA (Research & Data Analysis)

- Identified key business questions

-Explored trends, patterns, and anomalies

-Performed descriptive statistics

## 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

-Handled missing values

-Removed duplicates

-Standardized column names

-Corrected inconsistent data types

-Treated outliers (if applicable)

## 4️⃣ SQL Analysis

-Data was loaded into:
-PostgreSQL
-MySQL
-SQL Server

## Performed:

- SELECT queries

- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

- GROUP BY and ORDER BY

- JOIN operations

- Window functions

- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

## 5️⃣ Dashboard Development (Power BI)

- Imported cleaned dataset

-Created calculated measures (DAX)

-Built KPIs

-Designed interactive visuals

- Added filters and slicers

## 6️⃣ Reporting

Created a structured analytical report

Highlighted business insights

Provided actionable recommendations

## 7️⃣ Presentation (Gamma)

Designed a professional PPT

Summarized findings visually

Presented key insights and dashboard screenshots

# 📊 Dashboard Highlights
